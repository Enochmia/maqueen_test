## Code Editor link

* [Link](https://makecode.microbit.org/#editor)

## Developed list

* Code which lead robot to follow learned person's face via huskylens's face recognition algorithm - Couldn't test it, cuz lack of power
* Code which follow black line via Maqueen bot's line tracking sense - Unstable and lack of ability to follow right angle lines


* As a writer : Need to develop more stable code and more content to teach for 2 hours. And also ppt, mentor recruiting, updating microbti main board firmware and huskylens' firmware-took some while-, and practice for errors that might occur during event.
  #### Those are everything as I think so. :)
